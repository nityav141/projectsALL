        <h3>ABOUT BLACKPINK</h3>
        <p>In 2016 BLACKPINK debuted. By 2019 the act — composed of Jennie, Jisoo, Rosé and Lisa —  became the first K-pop girl group to perform at Coachella — a set that also marked the foursome’s first full U.S. concert. And tonight, in 2023, the global superstars became the first Korean act to headline the festival.

           “So… let me start off with, four years ago we were invited to perform here for you at Coachella at the Sahara tent and that made a mark in all of our hearts,” Rosé affectionately tells the crowd. ”I must say, this is a dream come true … the reason all four of us are here is because of you.”</p>
        
        <p>“We are so so happy to be back here,” adds Jennie. “It’s crazy within the four years we made it from Sahara to main stage … we love you, Coachella.”

            Despite an early technical issue that pushed the start time back, by 9:24 fans’ light-up bracelets started to glow pink, alerting them the show would in fact soon begin. By 9:28, a single “BLACKPINK” echoed throughout the speakers. And by 9:30, the stage went dark. It was finally time.</p>
            <p>“Taste that pink venom, get ‘em get ‘em get ‘em,” the girls demand as they opened with the biting “Pink Venom” as their loyal Blinks eat up every word. “Kill This Love” comes next, featuring heavy pyro and sparks followed by “How You Like That.” Each song feels like a grand finale in its own right — and that same energy carries throughout the entire historic set that snakes through BLACKPINK’s tight discography of an EP (Square Two – EP) and three full-lengths, BLACKPINK IN YOUR AREA, THE ALBUM and last year’s BORN PINK.</p>
